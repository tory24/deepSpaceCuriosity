# Deep Space Curiosity

Using NASA's Image Archive API, this app will load in a single image from their archive at a time, along with the image's description, title and other relevant information.

### Why

I have already built one app that uses an API, however I mostly followed someone else's JS to complete that project. This time round I managed to complete the project myself.

Also space & science are pretty darn cool.

### Notes

I realised that the archive I am pulling from only contains 100 images. Will find a larger file base.

Idea's for future changes:
* Add a star-like background.
* Make the page reload itself every 30 seconds.
* Search for images, videos & audio.
