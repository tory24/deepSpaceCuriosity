# Deep Space Curiosity

Using NASA's Image Archive API, this tool will load in a single image from their archive at a time, along with the image's description, title and other relevant information.
I've layered this all on top of _Vincent Garreau's particles.js_ for a subtle but neat star-like effect, to make the page seem a bit more active.

### Why

I have already built one app that uses an API, however I mostly followed someone else's javascript to complete that project, this time round I managed to complete the project myself.

Also space & science are pretty darn cool.

### Notes

I realised that the archive I am pulling from only contains 100 images. Will hopefully find a larger file base.

Idea's for future changes:
* Make the page reload itself every 30 seconds.
* Allow for videos & audio as well.
* Search through the entire image archive.
